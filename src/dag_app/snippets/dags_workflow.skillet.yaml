description: |
  This workflow steps through the elements to provide a user dropdown DAG list
    and assign a user into the DAG based on their IP address. In this example App, it is first
    required to authenticate to Panorama. This will fetch the list of available DAGs and allow
    the user to choose which one they would like to be assigned.
